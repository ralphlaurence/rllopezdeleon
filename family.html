                                    <br> First of all, I love you, I am truly thankful for you guys for i would not become the person that i am today without my family. Like atoms, you are also the building blocks of my life. My love for my family in incomprehendable, for I owe me life for the people that gave me love unconditionally, even when there are times i neglect your helpful advices and wisdoms you show upon me just make me grow to be a better person, those moments that i listen to nothing more than myself, For the incidents and badly made decisions that I have done, i fully regretted that I hurt the people that are always by my side, the people who chose to accept me even in harsh circumstances. I am sorry. I may not be a person with talents nor academic honors , but i will do every grateful thing to make you proud. I wish for you to live a happy yet peaceful life, full of love, enjoyment, and with people whom are dear to you; a life worth fighting for, just to explore the wonderful and beautiful experiences aroung the world. Also, more time to love yourself more and feel contented on what you already have. thank you.
